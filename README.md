# Data_Engenering
I work with different reports generated by an ERP. Those archives are in a XLSX format, which I used to use Excel or Libre Office Calc to handle those data. I'm applying Python now to analise these more properly and efficiently.

I'm attaching an example of an archive generated in a period of time, to see which products were bought, their ID,  suppliers, the data it were put on the system and the expense of each item.

The file 'analises_v2.xlsx' contains all the products and details of purchase described above. The file 'type_data.xlsx' has the description of each product, and, it contains the 'type' of product, as: medications, disposables, constrasts. This file has the description too, that will be importante to consolidate the final report.

The file 'data_structured.xlxs', has the result of these manipulations. The Python file 'funcoes_analise.py' has all the functions that were used to manipulate the data.

In the end, I use these final report do generate B.I. dashboard and to generate some simple insights as: how much we can still spend in the month, which kind of products hurt our budget and which kind of products we are buying more.
