# Data_Engenering
I work with different reports generated by an ERP. Those archives are in a XLS format, which used to use Excel or Libre Office Calc to handle those data. I'm applying Python now to analise these data more properly and rapidly.

I'm attaching an example of an archive generated in a period of time, to see which products were boughts, which suppliers, the data it were put on the system and the expense of each item.
